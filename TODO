The meta-pareon layer is still work-in-progress.

Known issues:
* alsa-lib (and several other recipes) in ./configure redefine CC to gcc.
  This breaks instrumentation
* applications should not be build with MMX/SSE/AVX optimizations, e.g. 
  qtbase5 will break.
* applications that use __builtin_return_address fail to compile correctly,
  in most cases the code itself can deal with this if configured appropriately.
